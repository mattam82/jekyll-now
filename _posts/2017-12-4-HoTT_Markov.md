title: A variant of Markov's principle in HoTT
---

I've been playing with this proof which I already found quite neat in pure Coq
and adapting it to HoTT using truncation instead of double negation. In two
words, it works!
[HoTT_Markov](coq/HoTT_Markov.html)
([source](http://github.com/mattam82/mattam82.github.io/raw/master/coq/HoTT_Markov.v), requires the [HoTT library](http://github.com/HoTT/HoTT)).
